This interactive dashboard is a project created as part of the DQLAB Bootcamp Machine Learning Batch 7. It is designed to provide insights into heart disease prediction using machine learning. The project allows users to explore data related to heart disease, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and make predictions with machine learning models.

## Features

- **Heart Disease Overview:** Get an introduction to heart disease, its prevalence, and the importance of early detection.

- **Data Exploration:** Dive into the dataset's details, explore distributions, and understand correlations among variables.

- **Machine Learning Prediction:** Utilize machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.

## Getting Started

To run this Streamlit app on your local machine:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the app with `streamlit run app.py`.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various attributes related to heart health and the presence of heart disease.
